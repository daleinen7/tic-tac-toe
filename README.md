# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Required Tasks
+ ~~Display empty grid/board~~
+ ~~A player can click on the grid to make a move~~
+ ~~Every click will alternate between marking an X and an O~~
+ ~~Once occupied with an X or an O the cell cannot be played again~~
+ ~~Provide a reset game button~~

## Bonus Tasks
+ ~~Display Who's turn it is~~
+ ~~Provide win logic and display a winning message~~
+ ~~Provide logic for cat's game~~
+ ~~Add your personal touch with unique styling~~


## Bugs
+ ~~If win is the last move, it doesn't register the winner~~
+ ~~Players can continue even after there is a winner~~

## Note
+ full disclosure, a developer friend looked over my CSS and she had suggestions (baby's first pull request merge)
+ ... further full disclosure I looked at the solution to find how to store the winning coditions logbook. As well as the single line to check against the current grid state
